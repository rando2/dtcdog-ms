## Discussion

This study applied an experimental paradigm to reveal qualitiative and quantitative differences in the breed ancestry estimates of six DTC dog genetic tests available through different companies.
By modulating whether DNA was submitted with a matched or mis-matched photograph, we evaluated whether this non-genetic information played a role in determining breed predictions made by different DTC dog genetic testing services.
Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, NASNet, allowed for these predictions to be compared to those made based on the photograph alone.

Most DTC testing services had a very high rate of predicting the registered breed of the DNA donor regardless of condition.
Unsurprisingly, the statistical analysis did not support an effect of condition on the chance that these tests would return the registered breed of hte DNA donor.
However, both NASNet and one DTC test, Accu-Metrics, showed the opposite pattern: they were unlikely to identify the registered breed as 100% of the ancestry, regardless of condition.
Instead, when breed ancestry estimates were evaluated at the clade level, a siginificant effect of the photograph the results of NASNet and Accu-Metrics became apparent, with the clades of the predicted breeds being very likely to match that of the photograph (Figure @fig:tern). 
This result was expected for NASNet, but suggests that Accu-Metrics breed predictions are influenced by the photograph.

It is important to note that this study did not evaluate the accuracy of the tests.
This point is especially important to note in the context of tests with extremely high performance.
While Wisdom Panel returned a prediction that matched the DNA donor's registered breed 100% of the time, this does not mean that it was more accurate than Embark or Orivet.
Differences among tests such as the number of markers analyzed (Table @tbl:tests) are expected to result in differences in resolution, and therefore differences in breed prediction.

(Note: this will probably change if we get Darwin's Ark results, since their resolution is very high too.)
As a specific example, Embark identified that the Labrador Retriever evaluated had 5.5% American Foxhound DNA, suggesting a Foxhound ancestor approximately five generations ago.
This individual dog's pedigree indicates that six of her 16 great-grandparents were enrolled in the AKC's Voluntary DNA Profile Program, which allows breeders to demonstrate the parentage of their dogs.
Therefore, the foxhound admixture is unlikely to come from these six lineages.
However, among the other ten great-grandparents, it is possible that one had mistaken parentage and an American Foxhound parent, especially since Embark's chromosome chart for this dog suggested inheritance of Foxhound ancestry from only one of her parents.
We can not conclude that this ancestry is or is not accurate based on the fact that other tests did not detect this small amount of admixture.
(Note: We can, however, reanalyze Embark's data with Darwin's Ark's algorithm if we want to).

Therefore our results suggest that at least one dog DTC genetic test is not providing accurate information about genetic ancestry because its results are influenced by the photographs provided.
Further investigation would be required to compare accuracy among the remaining five genetic tests.
For example, DNA My Dog returned some surprising results, such as identifying the purebred Bulldog as 10-20% wolf.
This result is consistent with a full wolf ancestor three generations back.
While the authors did not have access to this dog's four-generation pedigree, it would be surprising that such a high amount of wolf ancestry would be missed by other tests.
Because DNA My Dog uses copy number variation (presumably STRs), it is possible that different genetic tools tell different stories.

Such results are concerning because dog breed ancestry can have social and economic consequences for owners.
Many home insurance companies ban certain dog breeds.
In our current sample of twelve purebred dogs (none of which are banned by more than 5% of insurance companies [@url:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/banned-dog-breed-lists]), two dogs were identified as having ancestry from mroe than 50% of banned breeds lists by DNA My Dog (the Bulldog was identified as a wolf hybrid and the Beagle was identified as part Rottweiler), as were two additional dogs by Accu-Metrics (both the German Short-Haired Pointer and Golden Retriever were identified as part American Staffordshire Terrier).
None of these ancestry predictions were supported by any other tests.
Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that a dog owner could face severe financial reprecussions in terms of home insurance and even housing rental eligibility if DTC canine genetic tests become more widespread.

Such considerations are also important in the context of the other service that many DTC genetic tests provide: health predictions.
Some services (Embark, Wisdom Panel, and Orivet) provide information about specific risk variants that a dog does or does not carry.
The potential for such information to be misunderstood and misapplied has been discussed widely in discussion of the risks of DTC genetic testing broadly (need citations).
DNA My Dog and Accu-Metrics, on the other hand, provide general information about health risks based on the breeds detected.
Darwin's Ark, in contrast, does not provide health predictions because of a lack of rigorous standards for these estimations [@url:https://darwinsark.org/faqs].
Because consumers are likely to be interested in DTC health testing, this position raises interesting questions about what the ethical burden is for non-human DTC genetic testing.

Certainly, despite being priced similarly to human DTC test kits, DTC canine genetic testing is not held to the same regulatory standards as human testing, at least in the United States.
The human DTC market underwent a major shift in the mid-2010s when the FDA began regulating the health results they could provide consumers.
Anecdotes of similar tragic misinterpretations of genetic risk can also be found in the canine DTC space (e.g., [cite], co-authored by some of the develoeprs of Darwin's Ark's test). 
Here, we clearly demonstrate that ancestry predictions can differ widely among services.
Therefore, the extent to which health predictions differ among tests would also be an interesting question for future studies of the industry.

Additionally, the lack of regulation also presents ample opportunity for misinformation, even if unintentional.
The present study demonstrated that Accu-Metrics made breed predictions that were heavily influenced by the user-provided photograph; there was, in fact, no evidence that the results were influenced by the DNA.
In fact, this test identified the registered breed less often than NASNet.
All the same, this product has been promoted by companies such as the pet pharmacy PetMeds [@url:https://blog.petmeds.com/pet-supplies-products/viaguard-dnaffirm-canine-dna-testing-kit].
Without regulation of the industry, it is difficult to determine how such errors arise, but the present study suggests they are common.
Therefore, this systematic comparison of DTC genetic tests for dogs suggests that it is imperative that consumers approach the results of these tests with care.
In some cases, a photograph can change everything.
