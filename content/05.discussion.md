## Discussion

Applying an experimental paradigm to evaluate DTC canine genetic tests revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the breed ancestry estimates from six companies.
By modulating whether DNA was submitted with a matched or mismatched photograph, we assessed whether this non-genetic information influenced breed predictions.
In complement, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, NASNet, provided a baseline of predictions made from the photograph alone.
Ultimately, this analysis revealed a low rate of consensus across tests in estimating the breed makeup, even of registered purebred dogs, and suggested that at least one company is influenced by the photograph provided.

Both NASNet and Accu-Metrics were unlikely to identify the registered breed as 100% of the ancestry, regardless of condition.
When breed ancestry estimates were evaluated at the clade level, there were elevated odds that the clades of the breeds predicted by these two tests matched the photograph rather than the DNA donor (Figure @fig:tern).
For NASNet, which is an image recognition tool, this result was expected; however, Accu-Metrics requires a DNA sample.
The lack of a relationship between the company's breed predictions and the provided DNA samples suggests issues with the accuracy of the company's tests. 

In overall performance, Accu-Metrics was less successful in predicting a dog's breed than NASNet, with an overall rate of 0% versus 17% (Table @tbl:accuracy).
NASNet may have had even higher performance if more breeds were included in its training dataset, given that it did not have any point of reference for some of the breeds examined in this study (e.g., Chinese Crested).
The Chinese Crested photograph was, incidentally, the only photograph that Accu-Metrics identified as 100% matching the registered breed of the photographed dog (Supplementary Table 4); in this case, however, the photograph of the Chinese Crested was submitted along with DNA from a Brittany.

Among the remaining five DTC testing services, the rate of predicting the registered breed of the DNA donor was very high, regardless of the condition.
This result suggests that these companies are analyzing DNA as the basis for their breed ancestry predictions.
Additionally, we did not find evidence that the photographed breed or a close relative would be included in the predictions.
All the same, these five tests often differed in their breed predictions, and among the twelve purebred dogs tested, some received more consistent predictions than others.
For more than half the dogs, there was consensus among these five DTC genetic tests (excluding Accu-Metrics) about their breed (Table @tbl:accuracy).
Among the others, though the registered breed was always the major ancestry estimate from each of the five DTC tests, they often differed in what other breeds were predicted to contribute to ancestry.

While it is interesting to explore differences in their predictions, it is important to note that this study was not designed to evaluate the accuracy of the tests' genetic ancestry predictions.
Pedigrees are not infallible, and therefore mistaken parentage could be a source for some of this variation.
For example, in the case of the Labrador Retriever tested here, Embark and Darwin's Ark both predicted that she carried ~5% non-Labrador DNA, suggesting admixture approximately five generations ago.
This result is plausible within breeding and registration practices; the higher resolution markers used by these tests may be revealing present but minor ancestries or that annotating purebred dogs as a mixed breed is inducing a source of error in testing.
Therefore, even with the ground truth provided by using registered dogs, some sources of genetic variation are difficult to determine.
Wisdom Panel returned a prediction that matched the DNA donor's registered breed 100% of the time, but this does not mean it is more accurate than the other four tests.
Differences among tests, such as the number of markers analyzed (Table @tbl:tests) are expected to contribute to differences in test resolution and breed prediction capabilities.
Additionally, the specific breeds and specific dogs included in a companyâ€™s reference panel can have a strong effect on breed assignment.
Importantly, these results underscore the complexity of using genetic ancestry to infer membership in a socially defined population, i.e., breed.

These results highlight some of the challenges in developing genetic tools for genetic prediction of breed.
As one example, tests that identified the German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) as having 100% GSP ancestry were more commercially popular than the tests that identified mixed ancestry.
This pattern could arise if some of the genetic variants that the dog carries have not been sampled for the GSP reference panels used by the smaller companies (i.e., ascertainment bias).
In another example of disagreement in breed estimation, DNA My Dog was alone in reporting that the purebred Bulldog had 10-20% wolf ancestry.
This result would be consistent with a full wolf ancestor three generations ago.
While not all tests evaluate the genome for non-dog contributions, Embark, Wisdom Panel, Orivet, and DNA My Dog all do.
Therefore, it would be surprising for all the other tests to miss such a high percentage of wolf ancestry.
One possible explanation is that DNA My Dog uses copy number variation, whereas the other tests use SNPs (Table @tbl:tests).
It is well known that different genetic tools can paint different pictures of a population's history (e.g., [@doi:10.1111/mec.13038]).
However, a recent media report indicated that DNA My Dog failed to identify the species of a sample, assigning dog breeds to human DNA [@url:https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-dog-dna-test-1.6763274].
While our analysis provides evidence that the company did sequence the DNA samples we submitted, it is possible that other issues (e.g., contamination) could cause issues in both species identification and breed prediction.

This analysis demonstrates the complexity of and lack of standardization in the DTC dog genetic testing market.
In the case of Accu-Metrics, the results we received appeared to be independent of the DNA submitted.
Unfortunately, the average consumer is unlikely to have the necessary information or training to critically evaluate such aspects when selecting a DTC genetic test [@doi:10.1159/000327159].

Dog breed ancestry can have social and economic consequences.
Many home insurance companies refuse to cover certain dog breeds such as Pitbulls (e.g., American Staffordshire Terriers) and Rottweilers.
In our current sample of twelve purebred dogs (none of which are banned by more than 5% of insurance companies [@url:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/banned-dog-breed-lists]), four dogs were identified by at least one test as having ancestry banned by more than 50% of companies.
DNA My Dog identified the Bulldog as a wolf hybrid and the Beagle as part Rottweiler.
Accu-Metrics identified both the GSP and Golden Retriever as part American Staffordshire Terrier.
Dog owners using these tests to establish ancestry could face financial repercussions in terms of home insurance and even housing rental eligibility if the results of a DTC test are viewed as definitive [@realtor-insurance].
Given that DTC genetic services are being used by some rental companies for pet waste identification [@url:https://siouxlandnews.com/news/local/dna-testing-your-dog-why-apartment-complexes-are-now-making-it-a-requirement], it is not difficult to envision landlords conducting or requiring breed testing as well [@url:https://www.sltrib.com/news/homeprices/2021/06/18/some-utah-landlords-want].
Additionally, it is legal for companies to decline to insure or to raise premiums for dog owners who they believe own a restricted breed [@url:https://www.sltrib.com/news/homeprices/2021/06/18/some-utah-landlords-want].
While insurance companies do not typically require DNA tests, some sources advise renters and homeowners to submit their dog's results if they believe they were erroneously rejected for coverage [@url:https://www.mspca.org/pet_resources/home-insurance-and-pets].
While breed discrimination in renting and insurance is controversial, unreliable breed ancestry tests will only serve to further muddy an already complicated issue.

For more than a decade, concerns have been raised about the potential pitfalls of human DTC genetic testing, especially when combined with limited regulatory oversight.
Now, veterinary medicine faces related issues.
Our systematic comparison of DTC genetic tests for dogs suggests that consumers must approach DTC test results with caution.
Veterinarians are likely to be placed in a position where they need to educate pet owners about genetic tests that the veterinarians did not order or recommend.
This study shows that breed predictions from at least one vendor can be at odds with the dogs' pedigree registration, even for AKC-registered dogs (10 out of the 12 participants).
As DTC testing for pets becomes increasingly popular, veterinarians may face increasing calls to educate owners about the limits of genetic testing.
