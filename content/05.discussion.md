## Discussion

This study applied an experimental paradigm to assess the state of DTC dog genetic testing and revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the breed ancestry estimates of six providers.
By modulating whether DNA was submitted with a matched or mismatched photograph, we evaluated whether this non-genetic information influenced breed predictions.
Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, NASNet, allowed for these predictions to be compared to those made based on the photograph alone.
Ultimately, this analysis demonstrated a [%221-start] low rate of consensus across tests[%221-end] in estimating the breed makeup, even of registered purebred dogs, and suggests that results from at least one company are influenced by the photograph provided.

Most DTC testing services had a very high rate of predicting the registered breed of the DNA donor, regardless of condition.
Unsurprisingly, the statistical analysis did not support an effect of condition on the chance that these tests would return the registered breed of the DNA donor.
However, both NASNet and one DTC test, Accu-Metrics, showed the opposite pattern: they were unlikely to identify the registered breed as 100% of the ancestry, regardless of condition.
When breed ancestry estimates were evaluated at the clade level, there was a significant effect of the photograph on the predictions made by NASNet and Accu-Metrics.
The clades of the predicted breeds matched that of the dog in the photograph instead of the DNA donor (Figure {@fig:tern}).
This result was expected for NASNet, but suggests that Accu-Metrics breed predictions are influenced by the photograph.

It is important to note that this study was not designed to evaluate the genetic accuracy of the tests.
This point is especially important to note for tests with extremely high performance.
While Wisdom Panel returned a prediction that matched the DNA donor's registered breed 100% of the time, this does not mean it is necessarily more accurate than Embark or Orivet.
Differences among tests, such as the number of markers analyzed (Table {@tbl:tests}) are expected to result in differences in resolution and breed prediction.
As a specific example, Embark identified 5.5% American Foxhound DNA in the Labrador Retriever evaluated, suggesting a Foxhound ancestor approximately 5 generations ago.
This individual dog's pedigree indicates that six of her sixteen great-grandparents were enrolled in the AKC's Voluntary DNA Profile Program, which allows breeders to confirm their dogs' parentage.
Therefore, the foxhound admixture is unlikely to come from these six ancestors.
However, among the remaining ten great-grandparents, it is possible that one had mistaken parentage and an American Foxhound parent, especially since Embark's chromosome chart for this dog suggested inheritance of Foxhound ancestry from only one parent.
The other high-resolution test, Darwin's Ark, estimated a similar amount (5.9%) of non-Labrador ancestry for this dog.
However, Darwin's Ark does not currently include the American Foxhound in its reference panel and instead assigned this non-Labrador ancestry to Viszla (3.0%) and unknown (2.9%).
Without a third test to compare, or a foxhound DNA panel, it is impossible to know which test is accurate.
These results illustrate the effect the dogs in the reference panel can have on breed assignment.
Additionally, the finding of low-percentage admixture only by the highest-resolution tests underscores the challenges in determining whether a result is "accurate", even when testing purebred dogs.

Our results do strongly suggest that one company's predictions are influenced, at least in part, by the provided photograph.
The closer affinity between the breed predictions and the photograph than the actual DNA suggests that this company is not providing accurate information about genetic ancestry.
Further investigation would be required to assess the accuracy of the remaining five genetic tests.
[%245-start] For example, one test result indicated that the purebred Bulldog had 10-20% wolf ancestry.
This result would be consistent with a full wolf ancestor three generations ago.
While the authors did not have access to this dogâ€™s four-generation pedigree, it would be surprising that other tests would miss such a high amount of wolf ancestry.[%246-start][%247-start]
Because the test that produced this result, DNA My Dog, uses copy number variation rather than SNPs (Table {@tbl:tests}), it is possible that different genetic tools tell different stories.
Therefore, these findings suggest that methodological literacy is important to interpreting the results of DTC tests.

Unfortunately, the average [%247-end] consumer is unlikely to have the information or training to critically evaluate these features.
Lack of genetic literacy when provided DTC test results could be concerning because dog breed ancestry can have social and economic consequences for owners.
For example, many home insurance companies refuse to cover certain dog breeds such as pitbulls and rottweilers.
In our current sample of twelve purebred dogs (none of which are banned by more than 5% of insurance companies [@url:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/banned-dog-breed-lists]), two dogs were identified as having ancestry banned by more than 50% of companies DNA My Dog identified the Bulldog as a wolf hybrid and the Beagle as part Rottweiler, and Accu-Metrics identified both the German Short-Haired Pointer and Golden Retriever as part American Staffordshire Terrier.
None of these ancestry predictions were supported by any other DTC tests.
Therefore, it would be possible for dog owners to face severe financial repercussions in terms of home insurance and even housing rental eligibility if DTC canine genetic test usage became more widespread in housing practices.
Without significant oversight, highly innacurate predicted breed results can easily result in loss of home or insurance...

It is also important to consider the context of the other services that many DTC genetic tests provide: health predictions.
Some services (Embark, Wisdom Panel, and Orivet) provide information about specific risk variants that a dog does or does not carry.
The potential for such information to be misunderstood and misapplied has been discussed widely as a risk of DTC genetic testing in general (need [%263-start] [%264-start] citations[%263-end] ).
DNA My Dog and Accu-Metrics, on the other hand, provide general information about health risks based on the breeds detected.
Darwin's Ark, in contrast, has decided not to provide health predictions because of a lack of rigorous standards for these estimations [@url:https://darwinsark.org/faqs].
Because consumers are likely to be interested in DTC health testing, this position raises interesting questions about the ethical burden for non-human DTC genetic testing.

Despite being priced similarly to human DTC test kits, DTC canine genetic testing is not held to the same regulatory standards as human testing in the United States.
The human DTC market underwent a major shift in the mid-2010s when the FDA began regulating the health results they are allowed to provide to consumers [CITE FDA NOTICE/ARTICLE].
Anecdotes of similar tragic misinterpretations of genetic risk can also be found in the canine DTC space (e.g., [cite], co-authored by some of the developers of Darwin's Ark's test).
Here, we demonstrate that ancestry predictions can differ widely among services.
Therefore, the extent to which health predictions differ among tests would also be an interesting question for future studies of the industry.

Additionally, the lack of regulation also presents ample opportunity for misinformation, even if unintentional.
The present study found that results from one company, Accu-Metrics, did not appear to be influenced by the DNA provided.
Instead, there was suggestive evidence that predictions were influenced by the user-provided photograph.
This test identified the registered breed less often than NASNet, and a human genetic test produced by the same company reportedly assigned First Nations ancestry to canine DNA samples [@url:https://www.vice.com/en/article/435pnp/a-sketchy-dna-testing-service-said-dogs-had-first-nations-ancestry-viaguard].
Despite these issues, this product has been promoted by companies such as the pet pharmacy PetMeds [@url:https://blog.petmeds.com/pet-supplies-products/viaguard-dnaffirm-canine-dna-testing-kit].
It is difficult to determine how such errors arise without industry regulation, but the present study suggests they are common for at least some test providers.
Therefore, this systematic comparison of DTC genetic tests for dogs suggests that it is imperative that consumers approach the results of these tests with care.
In some cases, a photograph appears to change [%282-start] everything[%282-end] .
