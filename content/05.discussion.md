## Discussion

This study applied an experimental paradigm to assess the state of the DTC dog genetic testing industry and revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in the breed ancestry estimates of six DTC dog genetic tests.
By modulating whether DNA was submitted with a matched or mis-matched photograph, we evaluated whether this non-genetic information influenced the breed predictions made by different DTC dog genetic testing services.
Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, NASNet, allowed for these predictions to be compared to those made based on the photograph alone.
Ultimately, this analysis demonstrated a [%221-start] low rate of consensus across tests[%221-end] in estimating the breed makeup even of registered purebred dogs, and suggested that results from at least one company are influenced by the photograph provided.

Most DTC testing services had a very high rate of predicting the registered breed of the DNA donor, regardless of condition.
Unsurprisingly, the statistical analysis did not support an effect of condition on the chance that these tests would return the registered breed of the DNA donor.
However, both NASNet and one DTC test, Accu-Metrics, showed the opposite pattern: they were unlikely to identify the registered breed as 100% of the ancestry, regardless of condition.
Instead, when breed ancestry estimates were evaluated at the clade level, [%225-start] a significant effect of the photograph the results of NASNet and Accu-Metrics became apparent[%225-end], with the clades of the predicted breeds being very likely to match that of the photograph (Figure {@fig:tern}).
This result was expected for NASNet, but suggests that Accu-Metrics breed predictions are influenced by the photograph.

It is important to note that this study did not evaluate the genetic accuracy of the tests.
This point is especially important to note in the context of tests with extremely high performance.
While Wisdom Panel returned a prediction that matched the DNA donor's registered breed 100% of the time, this does not mean that it was more accurate than Embark or Orivet.
Differences among tests such as the number of markers analyzed (Table ??) are expected to result in differences in resolution, and therefore result in differences in breed prediction.
As a specific example, Embark identified 5.5% American Foxhound DNA in the Labrador Retriever evaluated, suggesting a Foxhound ancestor approximately 5 generations ago.
This individual dog's pedigree indicates that 6 of her 16 great-grandparents were enrolled in the AKC's Voluntary DNA Profile Program, which allows breeders to confirm the parentage of their dogs.
Therefore, the foxhound admixture is unlikely to come from these 6 ancestors.
However, among the remaining 10 great-grandparents, it is possible that one had mistaken parentage and an American Foxhound parent, especially since Embark's chromosome chart for this dog suggested inheritance of Foxhound ancestry from only one of her parents.
In fact, the other high-resolution test, Darwin's Ark, estimated a similar amount (5.9%) of non-Labrador ancestry for this dog.
However, Darwin's Ark does not currently include the American Foxhound in its reference panel, and instead assigned this non-Labrador ancestry to Viszla (3.0%) and unknown (2.9%).
Without a third test to compare, or a foxhound DNA panel, it is impossible to know which test is accurate.
Therefore, this is a clear illustration both of the influence of the reference panel on what breeds as assigned and of the fact that it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of these tests, even for purebred dogs.

We can, however, conclude from our results that at least one dog DTC genetic test is not providing accurate information about genetic ancestry.
Results from this test were demonstrably influenced by the photographs provided.
Further investigation would be required to assess accuracy among the remaining five genetic tests.
[%245-start] For example, one test result indicated that the purebred Bulldog had 10-20% wolf ancestry.
[%246-start] missed [%247-start] average [%247-end] consumer is unlikely to have the information or training to critically evaluate these features.

Lack of genetic literacy when provided DTC test results could be concerning because dog breed ancestry can have social and economic consequences for owners.
For example, many home insurance companies refuse to cover certain dog breeds such as pitbulls and rottweilers.
In our current sample of twelve purebred dogs (none of which are banned by more than 5% of insurance companies [@url:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/banned-dog-breed-lists]), two dogs were identified as having ancestry banned by more than 50% of [%253-start] [%254-start] companies DNA My Dog identified the Bulldog as a wolf hybrid and the Beagle as part Rottweiler, and Accu-Metrics identified both the German Short-Haired Pointer and Golden Retriever as part American Staffordshire Terrier.
None of these ancestry predictions were supported by any other DTC tests.
Therefore, it would be possible for dog owners to face severe financial repercussions in terms of home insurance and even housing rental eligibility if DTC canine genetic test usage became more widespread in housing practices.
Without significant oversight, highly innacurate predicted breed results can easily result in loss of home or insurance...

It is also important to consider the context of the other services that many DTC genetic tests provide: health predictions.
Some services (Embark, Wisdom Panel, and Orivet) provide information about specific risk variants that a dog does or does not carry.
The potential for such information to be misunderstood and misapplied has been discussed widely in discussion of the risks of DTC genetic testing broadly (need [%263-start] [%264-start] citations[%263-end] ).
DNA My Dog and Accu-Metrics, on the other hand, provide general information about health risks based on the breeds detected.
Darwin's Ark, in contrast, has decided not to provide health predictions because of a lack of rigorous standards for these estimations [@url:https://darwinsark.org/faqs].
Because consumers are likely to be interested in DTC health testing, this position raises interesting questions about what the ethical burden is for non-human DTC genetic testing.

Certainly, despite being priced similarly to human DTC test kits, DTC canine genetic testing is not held to the same regulatory standards as human testing, at least in the United States.
The human DTC market underwent a major shift in the mid-2010s when the FDA began regulating the health results they are allowed to provide to consumers [CITE FDA NOTICE/ARTICLE].
Anecdotes of similar tragic misinterpretations of genetic risk can also be found in the canine DTC space (e.g., [cite], co-authored by some of the developers of Darwin's Ark's test).
Here, we clearly demonstrate that ancestry predictions can differ widely among services.
Therefore, the extent to which health predictions differ among tests would also be an interesting question for future studies of the industry.

Additionally, the lack of regulation also presents ample opportunity for misinformation, even if unintentional.
This study demonstrates that Accu-Metrics breed predictions are heavily influenced by the user-provided photograph; there was, in fact, no evidence that the results were influenced by the DNA.
In fact, this test identified the registered breed less often than NASNet, the image prediction model, and a human genetic test produced by the same company reportedly assigned First Nations ancestry to canine DNA samples [@url:https://www.vice.com/en/article/435pnp/a-sketchy-dna-testing-service-said-dogs-had-first-nations-ancestry-viaguard].
Despite these issues, this product has been promoted by companies such as the pet pharmacy PetMeds [@url:https://blog.petmeds.com/pet-supplies-products/viaguard-dnaffirm-canine-dna-testing-kit].
Without DTC test industry regulation, it is difficult to determine how such errors arise, but the present study suggests they are frequent.
Therefore, this systematic comparison of DTC genetic tests for dogs suggests that it is imperative that consumers approach the results of these tests with care.
In some cases, a photograph can change [%282-start] everything[%282-end] .
