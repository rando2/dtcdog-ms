## Results

Twelve purebred dogs were recruited from households around the United States and sampled by their owners (Table {@tbl:subjects}).
Results were returned from the DTC genetic testing companies between August 2021 and February 2023.
For all dogs, at least one test returned a result consistent with 100% ancestry of the registered breed, and the registered breed was always the majority estimate (Figure {@fig:pies}).

Table: **Background information on the twelve canine participants.**
All dogs were registered with a breed organization (AKC = American Kennel Club; UKC = United Kennel Club; CKC = Continental Kennel Club). 
Breed clade was assigned based on phylogeny [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079] as opposed to the breed groups used by breed organizations such as the AKC.

Upon receiving the results, we noted that the primary outcome selected *a priori* did not capture apparent qualitative differences (Figure was driven by the fact that in several cases, the breeds predicted matched neither the DNA nor the photograph.
This pattern was particularly apparent for the image classifier and  one DTC test (ViaPet by Accu-Metrics).
In the case of the neural network, this was likely influenced in part by the fact that not all breeds have been labeled in ImageNet [@url:http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs].
In the case of the genetic test, it may have been influenced by the fact that the test predicted the registered breed zero times across both the control and treatment conditions (Table both tests, the predicted breeds were more similar to the photograph than  the DNA sample.
The effect of the treatment was significant for NASNet's predictions to the DNA donor (OR = 169).
In the case of Accu-Metrics... (update when more results are back).

Each dog is represented by a circle in blue (control) or red (treatment). 
The position of the circle relative to the three axes indicates the percentage of results belonging to the breed clade of the DNA donor, photographed dog, or other clades. 
A result that is 100% concordant with the DNA donor's registered breed will be placed at the apex of the triangle. 
A result that is 100% concordant with the photographed dog's breed (in the treatment condition only) will be located at the top left. 
Offset from these positions can be interpreted by looking at the position relative to the other two vertices on a 0 to 100 scale.
