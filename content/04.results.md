## Results

Twelve purebred dogs were recruited from households around the United States (Table @tbl:subjects).
Most results were returned from the companies between August 2021 and June 2023.
Results were not received for four samples.
One, sent to Darwin's Ark, was lost, with the company providing updates and offering to replace it.
The remaining three lost samples were sent to Accu-Metrics, and as of June 2023, no status update could be obtained.

Table:
Background information on the twelve canine participants.
All dogs were registered with a breed organization (AKC = American Kennel Club; UKC = United Kennel Club; CKC = Continental Kennel Club).
Breed clade was assigned based on phylogeny [@DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079] as opposed to the breed groups used by breed organizations such as the AKC.

Breed ancestry predictions from six DTC dog genetic testing companies as well as a pretrained image classifier.
For the control condition, the breeds of the donor and photograph match, so the registered breed is depicted as purple.
In the treatment condition, these are separated into blue (DNA donor) and red (photographed breed).
All other breeds are represented in other colors as identified in the legend.

### Mapping to Standardized Terminologies Enables Cross-test Comparisons

Test results were usually directly mapped to VBO terms [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.7996675; @icbo-vbo].
However, four breed estimates mapped ambiguously to terms in the VBO (Supplementary Table 1).
In one case, the result returned by NASNet ("Lhasa") was not a known dog breed, so "Lhasa Apso" was assumed to be the intended breed.
In the other three cases, two or more potential VBO terms could correspond to the breed result.
For two cases, VBO developers were consulted to select the best mapping.
The last ambiguous breed estimate was Catahoula Leopard Dog (DNA My Dog, estimated for German Short-Haired Pointer DNA submitted with Italian Greyhound photo).
The Catahoula Leopard Dog is a breed with a complex history that could correspond to three VBO entries.
However, as this result was returned only by one test for one dog, we selected the closest VBO term to the exact phrasing used in the breed result.
The translation of qualitative to quantitative results is provided in Supplementary Table 2, and the standardization of NASNet's predictions are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Another difference in the way results were reported across tests was that Darwin's Ark provided a two-component breed prediction.
As Darwin's Ark evaluates ancestry and genetic diversity separately, they provided not only the most genetically similar breeds but also explicitly predicted whether each dog was purebred.
We used their determinations of breed, rather than the ancestry percentages (Figure @fig:stackedbars), to assess whether Darwin Ark's result matched the registered breed (Table @tbl:accuracy).
Of the 11 samples for which results were returned, Darwin's Ark categorized all donors as purebred, even when some genetic variants were assigned to other breeds (Table @tbl:accuracy).

Table:
Comparison of predictions from DTC genetic tests and pretrained image classifier (NASNet) against the registered breed of each dog.
Note: for Orivet, the conditions were not balanced because, due to experimenter error, one control subject (Golden Retriever) was submitted with two photographs (the photograph of the DNA donor and of the Pomeranian).
Also, due to sample loss, only 11 dogs were tested using Darwin's Ark and 9 for Accu-Metrics versus 12 for the other tests.

### AI-Based Prediction with Canine Photographs was Accurate with Breeds Included in Training

The neural network NASNet was, as expected, unable to predict DNA donor breed in the treatment condition, where the photograph and DNA sample did not match (Figure @fig:stackedbars).
While the neural network was often able to correctly identify the registered breed of the dog in the photographs it was provided, it sometimes identified breeds that were neither the DNA donor nor the photographed dog.
This pattern was likely influenced by the limited number of breeds in the training data, and thus category labels, used by ImageNet [@url:http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs].
For example, ImageNet does not include the Chinese Crested and Bulldog breeds, and therefore NASNet also failed to identify these breeds (Figure @fig:stackedbars; Supplementary Table 4).

### Most Tests Accurately Reflected Purebred Dogs' Registered Breeds

For all dogs, the registered breed was always the majority estimate across tests (Figure @fig:stackedbars; Supplementary Table 4).
However, most tests did not match every dog with its registered breed at 100%.
This primary outcome, selected *a priori* (Table @tbl:accuracy), therefore did not capture apparent qualitative differences in breed predictions (Figure @fig:stackedbars).
In several cases, the breeds predicted by a test matched neither the DNA nor the photograph.
This pattern was particularly apparent for both the image classifier and one DTC genetic test (ViaPet by Accu-Metrics).
In the case of this genetic test, this pattern may have been influenced by the fact that the test predicted the registered breed zero times across both the control and treatment conditions (Table @tbl:accuracy).

Re-evaluating the results at the level of breed clades (Figure @fig:tern) suggested potential explanations for results that matched the breed of neither the DNA donor nor the photograph.
The odds that these tests predicted a breed in the same clade as the DNA donor were 13 for NASNet and 11 for Accu-Metrics (Supplementary Table 5).
Given that NASNet assigned breeds based solely on photograph, it was expected to incorrectly predict the treatment samples (which had shuffled photos).
The fact that a similar effect was observed for predictions made by Accu-Metrics suggests that the photograph may have also influenced breed predictions made by this DTC genetic test.

Ternary plots identifying the breed clades of results predicted by each test.
Each dog is represented by a circle in blue (control) or red (treatment).
The position of the circle relative to the three axes indicates the percentage of results belonging to the breed clade of the DNA donor, photographed dog, or other clades.
A result that is 100% concordant with the DNA donor’s registered breed will be placed at the apex of the triangle.
A result that is 100% concordant with the photographed dog’s breed (in the treatment condition only) will be located at the top left.
Offset from these positions can be interpreted by looking at the position relative to the other two vertices on a 0 to 100 scale.
Darker colors indicate multiple circles mapping to the same position.
