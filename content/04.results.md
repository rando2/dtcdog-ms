## Results

Twelve purebred dogs were recruited from households around the United States and sampled by their owners (Table 1][25]).
Results were returned from the DTC genetic testing companies between August 2021 and February 2023.
For all dogs, at least one [DTC test returned a result 100% consistent with 100% the ancestry of the registered breed, and the registered breed was always the majority estimate (Figure {@fig:pies}).

Table 1: **Background information on the twelve canine participants.
** All dogs were registered with a breed organization (AKC = American Kennel Club; UKC = United Kennel Club; CKC = Continental Kennel Club).
Breed clade was assigned based on phylogeny [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079] as opposed to the breed groups used by breed organizations such as the AKC.

In some cases, terminology needed tomust be harmonized across studiestests.
For example, the term "British Bulldog" was used by Orivet to describe what the [%373-start] AKC %373-end] [and other DTC tests, as well as the AKC, termed a "Bulldog" [@url:https://www.orivet.com/store/canine-full-breed-profile].
Similarly, the tests reported results in somewhat different ways.
While most tests provided quantitative estimates of ancestry (e.g., 15.5% German Shepherd Dog), DNA My Dog and Accu-Metrics both provide a qualitative result, a range of percentages (e.g., 10-20% German Shepherd Dog).
These range-format estimates were converted to approximate numeric estimates for visualization purposes (i.e., Figure 1][26][).).). Another difference in the way results were reported across tests was that Darwin's Ark provided a formal breed prediction that did not necessarily match the ancestry percentage estimates; this was achieved by evaluating ancestry and genetic diversity separately, allowing them to explicitly identify whether if a dog was likely to be purebred. We used these determinations, rather than the percentages (Figure 1][26]), to assess whether Darwin Ark's result matched the registered breed (Table {@tbl:accuracy}).
Because our our analysis focused on evaluating whether the reported ancestry deviated from the expected ancestry, which [due to study design was always 100% of a single breed (purebred), minor differences in how results were reported by different companiesdifferent companies reported results did not affect our analyses. Most tests returned at least one result that did not match the dog's breed organization registration. , with The only exceptions being to this were Wisdom Panel, which always estimated the registered breed to be 100% of the ancestry, and Darwin's Ark, which was always able to discern that the donor was purebred based on lower genetic diversity (Table {@tbl:accuracy}).

** For the control condition, the breeds of the donor and photograph match, so the registered breed is depicted as purple.
In the treatment condition, these are separated into blue (DNA donor) and red (photographed breed).
All other breeds are represented in other colors as identified in the legend.

** The overall concordance with breed registration is reported, as well as the breakdown between the two conditionsand the breakdown between the two conditions are reported.
The Haldane-Anscombe correction was applied when one or more cells waswere zero.
p-values were calculated using Fisher's exact test.
Note: for Orivet, the conditions were not balanced because, due to experimenter error, one control subject (Golden Retriever) was submitted with two photographs, the photograph of the DNA donor and of another dog (Pomeranian).

Upon receiving the results, we noted that the primary outcome selected *a priori* did not capture apparent qualitative differences (Figure bewas driven by the fact that in several cases, the breeds predicted matched neither the DNA nor the photograph.
This pattern was particularly apparent for the image classifier and for one DTC test (ViaPet by Accu-Metrics).
In the case of the neural network, this was likely influenced in part by the fact that not all breeds have been labeled in ImageNet [@url:http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs].
In the case of the genetic test, it may have been influenced by the fact that the test predicted the registered breed zero times across both the control and treatment conditions (Table theseboth tests, the predicted breeds were more similar to the photograph than to the DNA sample, suggesting that the Accu-Metrics test used the dog's photographs in their analysis.
The effect of the treatment was significant effect, as expected, on the similarity offor NASNet's predictions to the DNA donor (OR = 169).
In the case of Accu-Metrics... (update when more results are back).

The position of the circle relative to the three axes indicates the percentage of results belonging to the breed clade of the DNA donor, photographed dog, or other clades. A result that is 100% concordant with the DNA donor's registered breed will be placed at the apex of the triangle. A result that is 100% concordant with the photographed dog's breed (in the treatment condition only) will be located at the top left. Offset from these positions can be interpreted by looking at the position relative to the other two vertices on a 0 to 100 scale. Darker colors indicate multiple circles mapping to the same position.]
