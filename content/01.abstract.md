## Abstract

Objective: Compare pedigree documentation and genetic test results to evaluate whether user-provided photographs influence the breed ancestry predictions of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests for dogs.

Animals: Twelve registered purebred pet dogs representing twelve different breeds.

Methods: Each dog owner submitted six buccal swabs, one to each of six DTC genetic testing companies. Experimenters registered each sample per manufacturer instructions. For half of the dogs, the registration included a photograph of the DNA donor. For the other half of the dogs, photographs were swapped between dogs. DNA analysis and breed ancestry prediction was conducted by each company. The effect of condition (i.e., matching versus shuffled photograph) was evaluated for each companyâ€™s breed predictions. As a positive control, a convolutional neural network was also used to predict breed based solely on the photograph.

Results: Results from five of the six tests always included the dog's registered breed. One test and the convolutional neural network were unlikely to identify the registered breed and frequently returned results that were more similar to the photograph than the DNA. Additionally, differences in the predictions made across all tests underscore the challenge of identifying breed ancestry, even in purebred dogs.

Clinical Relevance: Veterinarians are likely to encounter patients who have conducted DTC genetic testing and may be asked to explain the results of genetic tests that they did not order. This systematic comparison of commercially available tests provides context for interpreting results from consumer-grade DTC genetic testing kits.
