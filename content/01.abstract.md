## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Objective: 
To evaluate whether the breed ancestry predictions of direct-to-consumer genetic tests for dogs are influenced by the photograph provided

Animals:
Twelve pet dogs considered purebred (i.e., registered with a breed organization) representing twelve different breeds

Methods:
Six buccal swabs were collected from each dog by the owner and submitted to each of six DTC genetic testing companies.
Experimenters registered each sample with the company.
For half of the dogs, the registration included a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photographs were swapped between dogs.
Analysis of the DNA and breed ancestry assignment was conducted by each company.
Their breed predictions were evaluated to determine whether the photograph affected the odds that the test identified the registered breed as 100% of the ancestry.
A convolutional neural network was also used to predict breed based on solely on the photograph as a positive control.

Results:
Five of the six tests always produced results that included the registered breed.
One test and the convolutional neural network were unlikely to identify the registered breed, and also frequently returned results that included the breed in the photograph.
This result suggests that one test on the market is relying on the photograph more than the DNA sample.
Additionally, differences in the predictions made across all tests underscore the challenge of identifying breed ancestry, even in purebred dogs.

Clinical Relevance:
Veterinarians are likely to encounter patients who have conducted DTC genetic testing and may find themselves in the position of explaining genetic test results that they did not order.
This systematic comparison of test on the market provides context for interpreting unexpected results.
