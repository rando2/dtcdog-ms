## Introduction

<!--Market info?-->
The industry of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing has risen in popularity throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s.
Such tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home, ship it to a company, and receive a report containing information about their ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing certain genetic traits (e.g., hair color) and risk of developing various genetic diseases.
The potential for misinterpretation of these results by the consumer led to a 2012 ruling by the FDA (fill in info about 23 and Me).

As human DTC tests have become better regulated, a new industry has sprung up: DTC testing for companion animals, most notably dogs.
Instead of swabbing their own cheek, consumers collect a buccal swab from a pet that is then analyzed for ancestry (breed mix) and/or genotypes associated with certain traits or diseases.
These tests, which are priced similarly to human DTC test kits, are not held to the same regulatory standards in the United States.
As a result, there is ample opportunity for abuse.

Dog breed ancestry has been studied since [xx].
Because dog breeds are, in the strict sense, closed breeding populations, genetic variants associated with a specific breed can be identified.
Therefore, the ability of a dog breed ancestry test to assign breed(s) depends on two variables: first, the density of markers analyzed, and second, the number of breeds and number of individuals from each breed the results are compared against.
Most of these DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms on a chip.
The number of SNPs evaluated varies widely.
Additionally, the make-up of the panel of dogs against which results are compared varies widely.
As a result, it is expected that results would typically vary somewhat across tests.

However, crowd-sourced compendia of results such as the "DoggyDNA" subreddit [@url:https://reddit.com/r/doggydna] revealed that some users received wildly different results from different tests.
In investigating such discrepancies, we noted that most of these tests include the option to upload a photograph, and some even require one.
Depending on how the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could hold the potential to bias results.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample influenced the results received.

To accomplish this, we recruited 12 purebred dogs and submitted their samples to six DTC dog genetic testing companies.
For half the dogs, the DNA sample was submitted with the correct picture.
For the other half, photos were swapped.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph uploaded has a significant effect on whether each test could identify the dog's actual breed.

Additionally, in the world of artificial intelligence, dog breed classification has become a standard problem for image identification.
Prior efforts to identify classifiers that perform well on this task suggest that the pre-trained models inception-ResNet-v2 [@doi:10.1109/SISY.2018.8524715] and NASNet [@url:https://github.com/wandering007/nasnet-pytorch] can perform with up to 90% accuracy on this task.
In such cases, a model is trained on images from a large compendium (in these cases, ImageNet) and then the model is made available and can be applied to new problems.
Therefore, we were also able to evaluate each dog's photograph using these top-performing models to assess which breeds were predicted based on the photograph alone.
