## Introduction

The study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years [@doi:10.1038/nrg701].
Animal genetic testing is a booming industry that is expected to continue growing over the next five years [@url:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2188474/0/en/Animal-Genetics-Market-revenue-to-cross-USD-6-4-Bn-by-2027-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs [@doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.025] and cats [@doi:10.1016/j.mcp.2012.04.004] for over a decade.
Over that same time period, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for humans has grown into an established industry.
Such tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home, ship it to a company, and receive a report containing information about their ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing certain genetic traits (e.g., hair color) and risk of developing various genetic diseases.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a parallel industry of DTC genetic profiling of companion animals, primarily dogs, has also emerged.
Instead of swabbing their own cheek, consumers collect a buccal swab from a pet that is then analyzed for ancestry (breed mix) and/or genotypes associated with certain traits or diseases.
Because dog breeds are, in the strict sense, closed breeding populations, dog breed ancestry can be estimated on the basis of genetic variants associated with specific breeds.
Therefore, the ability of a dog breed ancestry test to assign breed(s) depends on two variables: first, the density of markers analyzed, and second, the breeds and diversity of individuals from each breed available to compare the results against.
Most of these DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a microarray, or "chip", but some use whole-genome sequencing or even copy-number variation, presumably of short-tandem repeats (STRs) (Table @tbl:tests).
The genetic variation observed in an individual dog is then compared against a panel of genetic variants from a variety of breeds using algorithms that are typically proprietary.
This approach allows for classification of the individual's genetic variants to assign one or more breeds as sources of genetic ancestry.

**Comparison of six DTC dog genetic testing services.**
These were the six tests on the market at the end of 2021, when the present study began.
To the extent that the information is available, each test uses a distinct combination of genotyping technologies, breed classification algorithms, and reference panels.
While this study focuses on the methodologies, a detailed breakdown of consumer-oriented similarities and differences among several of these tests is available elsewhere [@url:https://www.caninejournal.com/dog-dna-tests-reviews].

Because the methodologies used to assign ancestry and the make-up of the comparison panels are likely to differ, it is expected that results would typically vary across tests.
However, crowd-sourced results, as available through the "DoggyDNA" subreddit [@url:https://reddit.com/r/doggydna], suggest that some users receive wildly different results, beyond what would be expected on the known differences in methodologies.
In investigating such discrepancies, we noted that most of these tests include the option or required the user to upload a photograph.
Depending on how the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could hold the potential to bias results.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample influenced breed ancestry estimation by six DTC dog genetic testing companies.

To accomplish this, we recruited purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples along with a photograph to six companies (Table @tbl:tests).
For half the dogs, the DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photos were swapped between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different purebred dog.
We evaluated whether predicted breeds matched the donor's registered breed.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph had a significant effect on ancestry estimation.
In doing so, we are able to provide a formal comparison of differences in breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
