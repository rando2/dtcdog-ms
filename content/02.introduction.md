## Introduction

The study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years [@doi:10.1038/nrg701].
Animal genetic testing is a booming industry that is expected to grow over the next five years [@url:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2188474/0/en/Animal-Genetics-Market-revenue-to-cross-USD-6-4-Bn-by-2027-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs [@doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.025] and cats [@doi:10.1016/j.mcp.2012.04.004] for over a decade.
Over that same time, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for humans has grown into an established industry [CITE].
These tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home and ship it to the company to be processed, sequenced, and analyzed.
The company then returns a report about the individual's ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing genetic traits (e.g., hair color) or risk of developing genetic diseases.

A parallel industry of DTC genetic profiling of companion animals, primarily dogs, has also emerged.
Dogs were the first domesticated animal [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2907.1992.tb00122.x], and dog husbandry has a rich history [@doi:10.1016/j.crvi.2010.12.011; @doi:10.21071/pbs.v0i7.11494].
As a result of these practices, modern dog breeds are more differentiated than subpopulations of many other species, and individual breeds are associated with distinct genetic signatures [@doi:10.1007/s00335-011-9387-6]. 
The breed ancestry of an individual dog can be estimated based on the presence of genetic variants associated with specific breeds.

For these companion tests, consumers collect a buccal swab from a pet.
That pet sample is then shipped to the company, which sequences and analyzes it.
Most DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using microarray-based profiling, but some genotype samples using other techniques.
Regardless, the goal of this type of testing is to identify genetic variants in an individual dog that can be compared against a panel of genetic variants sampled from a variety of breeds.
This approach allows for classification of the individual's genetic variants to assign one or more breeds, which can then be deconvolved into measured sources of genetic ancestry.
The genotypes can also be analyzed for association with certain traits or diseases.
Therefore, these analyses depend on three variables: first, the density of markers analyzed; second, the set of breeds included in the reference panel; and third, and diversity of individuals from each breed available within the panel.
Typically, however, the specific processes are proprietary, and the consumer receives only a report outlining their dog's estimated breed ancestry and/or the presence of known genetic risk variants.

We evaluated six DTC tests on the market at the end of 2021 when our study began.
However, crowd-sourced results, as available through the "DoggyDNA" subreddit [@url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA], suggest that some users receive wildly different results, beyond what would be expected based on the known methodologic differences.
Most of the DTC tests either include the option for or require the user to upload a photograph of the dog, despite the tests being advertised as based on genetics only.
Depending on how the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could bias the results.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample influenced breed ancestry estimation by six DTC dog genetic testing companies.

We recruited twelve purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples along with a photograph to six companies.
For half the tests, the DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photos were swapped between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different purebred dog.
We evaluated whether predicted breeds matched the donor's registered breed.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph affected ancestry estimation.
We added a photograph-only baseline using a deep neural network trained to identify dog breeds [@arXiv:1912.03151].
This design allows us to provide a formal comparison of differences in breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
