## Introduction {#introduction-1}

Clinical genetic testing is an invaluable tool for human and veterinary medicine [@doi:dntg9j; @doi:gr9hjb].
Though clinical veterinary medicine has emerged relatively recently, the study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years[@url:https://doi.org/dntg9j; @url:https://doi.org/gr9hjb].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs[@url:https://doi.org/bsq7pk] and cats[@url:https://doi.org/dr4ht3] for over a decade, and animal genetic testing is a booming industry that is expected to grow over the next five years[@url:https://doi.org/f4gjgw].
Increasingly, the decision to conduct genetic testing of both humans and companion animals occurs outside of the clinic.

Over the past 30 years, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing of humans has grown into an established industry[@url:https://doi.org/gr9hh9].
These tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home and ship it to the company to be processed, sequenced, and analyzed.
The company then returns a report about the individual's ancestry and, in some cases, the likelihood of possessing genetic traits (e.g., hair color) or risk of developing genetic diseases.
Recently, a parallel industry of DTC genetic profiling of companion animals, primarily dogs, has also emerged.
The dog equivalent of these ancestry estimates is the identification of the breed make-up of an individual pet.
Dogs were the first domesticated animal[@url:https://doi.org/b29ssc], and dog husbandry has a rich history [@doi:b7dmx4; @doi:gr9cb6].
As a result of dog breeding practices, modern dog breeds are more differentiated than subpopulations of many other species, and individual breeds are associated with distinct genetic signatures[@url:https://doi.org/b7dmx4; @url:https://doi.org/gr9cb6], allowing the breed ancestry of a particular dog to be estimated based on the presence of genetic variants associated with specific breeds.
Additionally, the genetic etiology of many canine diseases is known (e.g.,[@url:https://doi.org/fz2qt3]), allowing DTC genetic testing companies to predict individual dogs' risk of developing various diseases.

For companion animal DTC genetic tests, the consumer collects a buccal swab from a pet that they ship back to the company, which sequences and analyzes the animal's DNA.
Most DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms using microarray-based profiling, though some use other genotyping techniques (see Table 1).
In all cases, the stated goal is to identify genetic variants in an individual dog that can be compared against a panel of genetic variants sampled from a variety of breeds.
This approach allows for classification of the individual's genetic variants to one or more breeds, which can then be deconvolved into measured sources of genetic ancestry.
The genotypes can additionally be analyzed for association with certain traits or diseases (usually for an extra fee).
Therefore, these analyses depend on three variables: first, the density of markers analyzed; second, the set of breeds included in the reference panel; and third, and diversity of individuals from each breed available within the panel.
Typically, however, the specific approach used is proprietary, and the consumer receives only a report outlining their dog's estimated breed ancestry and/or the presence of known genetic risk variants.
Therefore, the specifics of how these estimates are made and their accuracy remains largely unknown.

This lack of transparency raises questions, especially in cases where different tests produce different results.
Crowd-sourced DTC dog genetic testing results, available through the "DoggyDNA" subreddit[@url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA], suggest that some dogs receive wildly different breed assignments from different companies, beyond what would be expected based on the known methodological differences.
One potential source of variation could be that all companies either allow or require the user to upload a photograph of the dog, despite the tests being advertised as based on genetics only.
If the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could bias the results.
Unfortunately, because most of the dogs whose results are uploaded to the DoggyDNA subreddit are mixed-breed, it is impossible to evaluate the ground truth using these crowd-sourced results to compare different companies' genetic ancestry estimates.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a purebred dog's DNA sample influenced estimates of their breed ancestry.

We evaluated the six DTC tests on the market at the end of 2021 (when our study began).
We recruited twelve purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples along with a photograph to each company.
For half the tests, the DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photos were between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different purebred dog.
To evaluate whether the photograph affected ancestry estimation, we checked whether predicted breeds matched the donor's registered breed.
We also evaluated samples using a photograph-only baseline that used a deep neural network trained to identify dog breeds[@url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03151].
This design allows us to provide a formal comparison of differences in breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
