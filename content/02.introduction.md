## ## Introduction

The study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years [@doi:10.1038/nrg701].
Animal genetic testing is a booming industry expected to grow over the next five years [@url:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2188474/0/en/Animal-Genetics-Market-revenue-to-cross-USD-6-4-Bn-by-2027-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs [@doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.025] and cats [@doi:10.1016/j.mcp.2012.04.004] for over a decade.
Over that same time period, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for humans has grown into an established industry.
Such tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home, ship it to a company, and receive a report containing information about their ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing certain genetic traits (e.g., hair color) and risk of developing various genetic diseases.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a parallel industry of DTC genetic profiling of companion animals, primarily dogs, has also emerged.
Consumers collect a buccal swab from a pet that is then analyzed for ancestry (breed mix) and/or genotypes associated with certain traits or diseases.
Because dog breeds are, in the strict sense, closed breeding populations, dog breed ancestry can be estimated based on genetic variants associated with specific breeds.
Therefore, the ability of a dog breed ancestry test to assign breed(s) depends on  three variables: first, the density of markers analyzed; second, the set of breeds included in the reference panel; and third, and diversity of individuals from each breed available within the panel.
Many modern DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using  microarray-based profiling, but some use other techniques.
The genetic variation observed in an individual dog is then compared against   the reference panel of  breeds using algorithms that are typically proprietary.
This approach  assigns one or more breeds as sources of genetic ancestry for the individual's genetic variants.


We evaluated six DTC tests on the market at the end of 2021 when our study began.
One expects test results to differ between tests because the methodologies used to assign ancestry and the make-up of the comparison panels are likely to differ.
However, crowd-sourced results posted on the "DoggyDNA" subreddit [@url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA] suggest that some users receive wildly different results.
In investigating such discrepancies, we noted that most  tests include the option or required the user to upload a photograph.
Depending on how the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could potentially bias results.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample influenced breed ancestry estimation by six DTC dog genetic testing companies.

We recruited purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples and a photograph to six companies .
For half the dogs, we submitted the DNA sample  with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, we swapped photos  between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different purebred dog.
We evaluated whether predicted breeds matched the donor's registered breed.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph affected  ancestry estimation.
We added a photograph-only baseline using a deep neural network trained to identify dog breeds.
This design allows us  to provide a formal comparison of differences in breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
