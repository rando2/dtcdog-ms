## Introduction

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing has risen in popularity throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s.
These tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home, ship it to a company, and receive a report containing information about their ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing certain genetic traits (e.g., hair color) and risk of developing various genetic diseases.
The potential for misinterpretation of these results by the consumer led to a 2012 ruling by the FDA (fill in info about 23 and Me).
As human DTC tests have become better regulated, a new industry has sprung up: DTC testing for companion animals, most notably dogs.
Instead of swabbing their own cheek, consumers collect a buccal swab from a pet that is then analyzed for ancestry (breed mix) and/or genotypes associated with certain traits or diseases.
These tests are priced similarly to human DTC test kits but are not regulated by any agency.
As a result, there is ample opportunity for abuse.

Breed ancestry has been studied since [xx].
Because dog breeds are, in the strict sense, closed breeding populations, genetic variants associated with a specific breed can be identified.
Therefore, the ability of a dog breed ancestry test to assign breed(s) depends on two variables: first, the density of markers they are analyzing, and second, the number of breeds and number of individuals from each breed they are comparing against.
Most of these DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms on a chip.
The number of SNPs evaluated varies widely.
Additionally, the make-up of the panel of dogs against which results are compared varies widely.

When examining the websites of DTC dog genetic tests, we noticed that many include the option to upload a photograph, and some even require it.
Additionally, crowd-sourced compendia of results such as the "DoggyDNA" subreddit (reddit.com/r/doggydna) revealed that the results users received could vary widely between different tests.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample would change the results received.
To accomplish this, we recruited 12 purebred dogs registered with the American Kennel Club and submitted their DNA to six DTC dog genetic testing companies.
For half the dogs, the DNA was submitted with the correct picture.
For the other half, photos were swapped between two dogs.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph uploaded has a significant effect on whether each test could identify the dog's actual breed.
