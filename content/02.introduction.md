## Introduction {#introduction-1}

Clinical genetic testing is an invaluable tool for human and veterinary medicine [@doi:10.1111/j.1939-1676.2000.tb01492.x; @doi:10.2147/PGPM.S48887].
The study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years [@doi:10.1038/nrg701].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs [@doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.025] for over a decade, and animal genetic testing is a booming industry that is expected to grow over the next five years [@url:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2188474/0/en/Animal-Genetics-Market-revenue-to-cross-USD-6-4-Bn-by-2027-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html].
Increasingly, the decision to conduct genetic testing of both humans and companion animals occurs outside of the clinic.
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home and ship it to the company to be processed, sequenced, and analyzed.
The company then returns a report about the individual's ancestry and, in some cases, the likelihood of possessing genetic traits (e.g., hair color) or risk of developing genetic diseases.

With canine genetic testing, ancestry estimates focus on the individual's breed make-up.
Dogs were the first domesticated animal and in the approximately 20,000 years [@doi:10.1038/ncomms16082] since domestication have been specialized for a plethora of phenotypes, such as herding and tracking abilities [@doi:10.1098/rspb.2019.0716].
As a result of these breeding practices,  modern dog breeds have significantly higher levels of homozygosity, leading to less genomic variation between individuals of the same breed, and therefore dog breeds are more easily differentiated than subpopulations of many other species.
Individual breeds are associated with distinct genetic signatures [@doi:10.1007/s00335-011-9387-6], allowing the breed ancestry of a particular dog to be estimated based on the presence of genetic variants associated with specific breeds.
Most DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms using microarray-based profiling, though some use other genotyping techniques (Table {@tbl:tests}).
In all cases, the stated goal is to identify genetic variants in an individual dog that are compared to genetic variants sampled from a variety of breeds.
The genetic variants are assigned to one or more breeds and then deconvolved into measured sources of genetic ancestry.
Therefore, these analyses depend on three variables: first, the density of markers analyzed; second, the set of breeds included in the reference panel; and third, and diversity of individuals from each breed available within the panel.
Typically, however, the specific approach used is proprietary, and the consumer receives only a report outlining their dog's estimated breed ancestry and/or genetic risk variants.
As a result, the specifics of how these estimates are made and their accuracy remains largely unknown.

This lack of transparency raises questions, especially in cases where different tests produce different results.
Crowd-sourced DTC dog genetic testing results on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA) suggest that some dogs receive wildly different breed assignments from different companies [@url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA/comments/psij1u/dna_my_dog_v_embark_results; @url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA/comments/p8dvmc/dna_my_dog_vs_embark_paid_for_an_embark_test; @url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA/comments/lgbikq/the_shelter_told_them_huskylab_but_the_truth_may], beyond what would be expected based on the known methodological differences [@AKCCurrentState].
One potential source of variation could be that all companies either allow or require the user to upload a photograph of the dog, despite the tests being advertised as based on genetics only.
If the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could bias the results.
Because most of the dogs whose results are uploaded to the DoggyDNA subreddit are mixed-breed, these crowd-sourced results cannot easily be used to compare different companies' genetic ancestry estimates because there is no ground truth available.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a purebred dog's DNA sample influenced estimates of their breed ancestry.

We evaluated the six DTC tests on the market at the end of 2021 (when our study began).
We recruited twelve purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples along with a photograph to each company.
For half the dogs, the sample was submitted with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photos were between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different, purebred dog.
To evaluate whether the photograph affected ancestry estimation, we checked whether breed predictions matched the donor's registered breed.
We also estabished a photograph-only baseline using a deep neural network trained to assign dog breeds to photographs [@arXiv:1912.03151].
This design allowed us to compare breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
