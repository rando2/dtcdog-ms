## Introduction


The study of genetic disease in animal models has a long history, and commercial genetic testing has been used to guide agricultural breeding practices for over 20 years [@doi:10.1038/nrg701].
Animal genetic testing is a booming industry that is expected to grow over the next five years [@url:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/08/2188474/0/en/Animal-Genetics-Market-revenue-to-cross-USD-6-4-Bn-by-2027-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html].
Commercial testing for genetic risk factors has been common for dogs [@doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.06.025] and cats [@doi:10.1016/j.mcp.2012.04.004] for over a decade.
Over that same time, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for humans has grown into an established industry [CITE].
These tests allow consumers to collect a specimen (usually a buccal swab) at home and ship it to the company to be processed, sequenced, and analyzed.
The company then returns a report about the individual's ancestry and, in some cases, likelihood of possessing genetic traits (e.g., hair color) or risk of developing genetic diseases.

A parallel industry of DTC genetic profiling of companion animals, primarily dogs, has also emerged.
For these companion tests , consumers are instructed to collect a buccal swab from a pet instead of swabbing their own cheek.
That pet sample is then shipped to the company, which sequences and analyzes it.
The sample is analyzed for ancestry (breed) and/or genotypes associated with certain traits or diseases.
The consumer receives a report containing this information, similar to the human DTC equivalent.
Dogs were the first domesticated animal [CITE], and dog husbandry has a rich history [CITE], and as a result, the genetic signature of dog breeds is more distinct than in many other species.
Additionally, dog breeds are, in the strict sense, closed breeding populations due to dog husbandry practices, and so an individual dog's breed ancestry can be estimated based on genetic variants associated with specific breeds.
Therefore, the ability of a dog breed ancestry test to assign breed(s) depends on two variables: first, the density of genetic markers analyzed, and second, the breed coverages and diversity of individuals from within each breed represented in the company's database.
Most DTC genetic tests assay single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a microarray, or "chip," while a few use whole-genome sequencing or copy-number variation, [%82-start] presumably [%83-start] %83-end] short-tandem repeats (STRs) (Table  ??).
).
The genetic variants observed in an individual dog are then compared against a panel of genetic variants from a variety of breeds and individuals using algorithms that are typically proprietary.
However, most approaches use unsupervised clustering and similarity metrics comparing their existing training data (sometimes including results from previous DTC tests) to the new dog sample.
This approach allows for classification of the individual's genetic variants to assign one or more breeds, which can then be deconvolved into measured sources of genetic ancestry.

**Comparison of six DTC dog genetic testing services.**
At the time of study design (end of 2021), six DTC dog genetic tests were available on the public market.
All 6 were included in this study.
Each test uses a distinct combination of genotyping technologies, breed classification algorithms, and reference panels (see {#tbl:tests}).
While this study focuses on the methodologies, a detailed breakdown of consumer-oriented similarities and differences among several of these tests is available elsewhere [@url:https://www.caninejournal.com/dog-dna-tests-reviews].

Because the methodologies used and the comparison panels are likely to differ, it is expected that results could vary across tests.
However, crowd-sourced results, as available through the "DoggyDNA" subreddit [@url:https://www.reddit.com/r/DoggyDNA], suggest that some users receive wildly different results, beyond what would be expected based on the known methodologic differences .
Most of the DTC tests either include the option for or require the user to upload a photograph of the dog, despite the tests being advertised as based on genetics only.
Depending on how the photographic information is incorporated into the breed identification pipeline, it could bias the results.
Therefore, we sought to assess whether the photograph uploaded with a DNA sample influenced breed ancestry estimation by six DTC dog genetic testing companies, in addition to their overall genetic accuracy.

We recruited 12 purebred dogs and submitted their buccal DNA samples along with a photograph to six companies (Table ??).
For half the tests, the DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of the DNA donor.
For the other half, photos were swapped between dogs so that each DNA sample was submitted with a photograph of a different purebred dog.
This design allowed us to evaluate whether the photograph had a significant effect on ancestry estimation.
Additionally, we evaluated whether DTC test breed predictions matched the donor's registered breed.
In doing so, we are able to provide a formal comparison of differences in breed ancestry estimation across different platforms.
