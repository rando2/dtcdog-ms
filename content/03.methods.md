## Methods

Dogs were recruited by word of mouth.
Breed organization registration of each dog was confirmed through viewing the paperwork or locating the dog in the Ammerican Kennel Club (AKC) database.
Each dog was randomized to either the control or treatment group, and dogs in the treatment group were paired.
These assignments were evaluated to ensure that dogs within a breed clade (per [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079]) were not paired.

Each DTC test kit was registered using the dog's own photograph (control) or the photograph of a paired dog (treatment) (Table @tbl:subjects).
The kits were then delivered to the owner, who was instructed to collect buccal swabs for each of the six kits in Table XX according to manufacturer instructions.
This design ensured that there could be no cross-contamination from another dogs in the study.

Table: Background information on the twelve dogs for whom buccal swabs were submitted.
All dogs were registered with a breed organization (AKC = American Kennel Club; UKC = United Kennel Club; CKC = Continental Kennel Club).
Breed clade is based on a genome-based phylogeny [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079] as opposed to the breed groups used by breed organizations such as the AKC.

Genetic testing was conducted by each DTC genetic testing company according to their own protocols.
The breed determination results were returned to the experimenters, who retrieved the results for each dog and recorded the determined breeds and the corresponding percentage composition in a spreadsheet.
In some cases, terms had to be matched across studies.
For example, the term "British Bulldog" is used by Orivet to describe what the other tests, as well as the AKC, termed a "Bulldog" [@url:https://www.orivet.com/store/canine-full-breed-profile].
Similarly, the tests report results in somewhat different ways.
Orivet, Darwin's Ark, and Embark provide a formal breed determination (e.g., assigned a breed to the dog or identified the dog as purebred).
DNA My Dog and Accu-Metrics both provide a qualitative range of percentages (e.g., 10-20%) rather than a quantitative estimate (e.g., 15.5%) like the other tests.
Additionally, DNA My Dog ran a separate analysis to identify wolf DNA, while Embark includes a "wolfiness" estimate in its report even for dogs without wolf in their estimated ancestry.
Therefore, our analysis focused on evaluating whether the reported ancestry deviated from the expected ancestry, which was always 100% of a single breed.

Finally, to assess the extent to which each photograph aligned with the registered breed of the dog, we used a pre-trained convolutional neural network, NASNet, to estimate the breed of each dog photograph.
NASNet has previously been shown to classify photographs of purebred dogs [@doi:10.1007/s11633-020-1261-0; @doi:10.1109/SISY.2018.8524715; @doi:10.1109/ICITEED.2019.8929955].
The NASNet model nasnetalarge was loaded from the Python package PyTorch Image Models (timm version 0.6.12) [@url:https://pypi.org/project/timm] and used to classify photos [@url:https://rwightman.github.io/pytorch-image-models/models/inception-resnet-v2].
Each owner-submitted photo, corresponding to each of the twelve dogs, was evaluated.
Because the estimates have a very long tail, only results greater than 1% are reported.
