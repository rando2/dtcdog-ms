### Selection of Tests

| Test/Company Name | Price | Market Share | Markers Used | Size of Panel | Specifics of Photograph |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Embark Breed Test |       |              |              |               | Not required            |

### Recruitment of Participants

Dogs were recruited primarily by word of mouth, though one participant was recruited at an American Kennel Club (AKC) dog show.
Breed organization registration of each dog was confirmed through viewing the paperwork or locating the dog in the Ammerican Kennel Club (AKC) database.
Each dog was randomized to either the control or treatment group and the kits were registered using the dog's own photograph (control) or the photograph of a paired dog (treatment).
The kits were then delivered to the owner, who was instructed to collect buccal swabs for each of the six kits in Table XX according to manufacturer instructions.
This design ensured that there could be no cross-contamination of the swabs with other dogs in the study.

### Analysis

The primary assessment was whether each test would identify the AKC-registered breed of the DNA donor.
To this end, we calculated the odds ratio of correct identification across the two conditions.
