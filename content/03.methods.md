### Recruitment of Dogs

Dogs were recruited by word of mouth and at AKC dog shows in the state of Pennsylvania.
The AKC number of name of the dog was confirmed against the AKC database.
Each dog was swabbed for the six kits in Table XX according to manufacturer instructions.
Each dog was then randomized to either the control or treatment group.
In the control condition, the DNA samples were submitted with a picture of the dog from which they were collected.
In the treatment condition, the samples were submitted with a picture of a different dog.
Dogs in the treatment condition were paired so that photos were swapped across the pair.

### Analysis

The primary assessment was whether each test would identify the AKC-registered breed of the DNA donor.
To this end, we calculated the odds ratio of correct identification across the two conditions.
