## Methods

Dogs were recruited primarily by word of mouth, though one participant was recruited at an American Kennel Club (AKC) dog show.
Breed organization registration of each dog was confirmed through viewing the paperwork or locating the dog in the Ammerican Kennel Club (AKC) database.
Each dog was randomized to either the control or treatment group and the kits were registered using the dog's own photograph (control) or the photograph of a paired dog (treatment).
The kits were then delivered to the owner, who was instructed to collect buccal swabs for each of the six kits in Table XX according to manufacturer instructions.
This design ensured that there could be no cross-contamination of the swabs with other dogs in the study.

Table X: Background information on the twelve dogs for whom buccal swabs were submitted.
All dogs were registered with a breed organization (AKC = American Kennel Club; UKC = United Kennel Club; CKC = Continental Kennel Club).
Breed clade is based on a genome-based phylogeny [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079] as opposed to the breed groups used by breed organizations such as the AKC.

Genetic testing was conducted by each DTC genetic testing company according to their own protocols.
We retrieved the results for each dog and recorded the determined breeds in a spreadsheet.
