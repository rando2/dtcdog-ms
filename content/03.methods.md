## Methods

Dogs were recruited by word of mouth between July and November 2022.
Breed organization registration of each dog was confirmed by viewing the dog's breed organization paperwork or locating the dog in the American Kennel Club (AKC) database.
Each dog was randomized to either the control or treatment group, and dogs in the treatment group were paired based on their enrollment order.
Assignments were evaluated to ensure that dogs within a breed clade (per [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.079]) were not paired.
All of the dogs enrolled came from different households.
This design avoided cross-contamination of dogs within the study.

We evaluated six tests on the market at the end of 2021, when the study began.
DTC genetic tests were purchased directly from each company's website.
To the extent that the information was available, each test used a distinct combination of genotyping technologies, breed classification algorithms, and reference panels (Table {#tbl:tests}).
While this study focuses on the methodologies, a detailed breakdown of consumer-oriented similarities and differences among several of these tests is available elsewhere [@url:https://www.caninejournal.com/dog-dna-tests-reviews].
Kits were registered according to the instructions provided using the dog's own photograph (control) or the photograph of a paired dog (treatment).
The kits were then delivered to the owner, who was instructed to collect buccal swabs for each of the six kits in Table {#tbl:tests} according to manufacturer instructions.
Genetic testing was conducted by each DTC genetic testing company according to their own protocols.
The breed determination results were returned to the experimenters, who retrieved the results for each dog and recorded the determined breeds and the corresponding percentage composition in a spreadsheet.
